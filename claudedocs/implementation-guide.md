   ```

2. **Update Navigation Component**
   ```bash
   # Copy unified navigation component
   cp public/components/unified-navigation.html your-components-directory/
   ```

3. **Test CSS Integration**

   - Update navigation active states based on current page

3. **Test Responsive Behavior**
   - Verify mobile navigation works correctly
   - Test responsive grid layouts on different screen sizes

### Phase 3: Enhancement (1-2 days)
1. **Interactive Features**
   - Implement real-time data updates
   - Add smooth page transitions
   - Enable advanced filtering and search

2. **Performance Optimization**
