# Requirements Document: Threads Authentication

## Introduction

The Threads Authentication system is the foundational component of Solead that enables secure multi-account session management for automated lead discovery. This feature manages browser sessions, stores encrypted cookies, monitors session health, and provides automatic refresh capabilities to maintain continuous access to Threads accounts without manual intervention.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports Solead's core mission of autonomous lead discovery by:
- Enabling 24/7 automated agent operations without manual login requirements
- Supporting multiple marketing accounts for broader lead coverage
- Ensuring security and compliance through encrypted credential storage
- Providing the authentication layer required for all agent activities

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Account Session Management

**User Story:** As a marketing manager, I want to manage multiple Threads accounts simultaneously, so that I can monitor different brand accounts and expand my lead discovery coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a new Threads account THEN the system SHALL create a new account entry with a unique identifier
2. IF a user attempts to add a duplicate account handle THEN the system SHALL reject the addition and display an error message
3. WHEN a user views their accounts THEN the system SHALL display all accounts with their current status (active, expired, suspended)
4. WHEN a user selects an account THEN the system SHALL show the associated agents and session health metrics
5. IF an account has no active session THEN the system SHALL display a "Session Required" status

### Requirement 2: Secure Cookie Storage

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my Threads session cookies encrypted and securely stored, so that my account credentials cannot be compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cookies are received from a browser session THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using AES-256-GCM before storage
2. IF encryption fails THEN the system SHALL reject the session and log the error without storing any data
3. WHEN cookies are needed for automation THEN the system SHALL decrypt them only in memory
4. WHEN a session is deleted THEN the system SHALL permanently remove all associated encrypted data
5. IF a decryption key is rotated THEN the system SHALL re-encrypt all existing sessions with the new key

### Requirement 3: Session Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want real-time visibility into session health, so that I can proactively address authentication issues before they impact lead discovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL check its validity every 30 minutes
2. IF a session health score drops below 0.5 THEN the system SHALL trigger an alert
3. WHEN a session check fails THEN the system SHALL increment the failure count and recalculate health score
4. IF failure count exceeds 3 THEN the system SHALL mark the session as unhealthy and pause associated agents
5. WHEN viewing session status THEN the system SHALL display health score, last activity, and expiration time

### Requirement 4: Automatic Session Refresh

**User Story:** As a user, I want sessions to automatically refresh before expiration, so that my agents can run continuously without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session TTL is less than 6 hours THEN the system SHALL initiate a refresh attempt
2. IF a refresh succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the session with new cookies and reset health score to 1.0
3. IF a refresh fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
4. WHEN all refresh attempts fail THEN the system SHALL mark the session as expired and notify the user
5. IF multiple sessions need refresh THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on remaining TTL

### Requirement 5: Browser Session Initialization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily create new browser sessions with my Threads credentials, so that I can start discovering leads quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing a new session THEN the system SHALL launch a browser with anti-detection measures
2. IF the user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Threads login page
3. WHEN cookies are captured THEN the system SHALL validate they contain required authentication tokens
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL retry the capture process once before reporting failure
5. WHEN a session is successfully created THEN the system SHALL immediately test it by accessing the home feed

### Requirement 6: Session Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper session lifecycle management, so that resources are used efficiently and security is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL set its initial state to VALIDATING
2. IF validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL transition the session to ACTIVE state
3. WHEN TTL approaches expiration THEN the system SHALL transition to EXPIRING state
4. IF a session expires THEN the system SHALL transition to EXPIRED and disable associated agents
5. WHEN a session is manually terminated THEN the system SHALL clean up all resources and encrypted data

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate modules for encryption, storage, monitoring, and refresh
- **Modular Design**: Session manager, cookie handler, and health monitor as independent services
- **Dependency Management**: Use dependency injection for database and encryption providers
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all session operations and data structures

### Performance
- Session validation must complete within 2 seconds
- Cookie encryption/decryption must complete within 100ms
- Health checks must not impact agent performance (run asynchronously)
- Support at least 100 concurrent sessions without degradation
- Database queries for session data must return within 50ms

### Security
- All cookies must be encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Encryption keys must be stored in AWS KMS or GCP Secret Manager
- Session data must never be logged in plaintext
- Failed authentication attempts must be rate-limited
- Implement audit logging for all session operations
- Use secure random generation for all session IDs

### Reliability
- System must maintain 99.9% uptime for session services
- Automatic failover for session refresh operations
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- Session state must be persisted to survive system restarts
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls

### Usability
- Session creation should require no technical knowledge
- Clear error messages for authentication failures
- Visual indicators for session health status
- One-click session refresh capability
- Bulk session management operations
- Export/import capability for session backup
